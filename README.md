Cataloging drinks featured on Best of the Worst

Trying to list the beers and cocktails consumed on Best of the Worst. Living in Wisconsin helps to document these items, and it's just been a fun time waster to try to figure them out from sometimes just a few frames. Usually I can narrow it down to a particular brewery and then go from there. Sometimes, they'll be either hidden or facing the wrong way, so help is appreciated.

Cheers!
